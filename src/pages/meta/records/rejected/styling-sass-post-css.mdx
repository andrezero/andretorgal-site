<Abstract>

We are using [Sass + PostCSS](/meta/records/rejected/styling-sass-post-css) all the way, but can we have modules, and can we have them strongly typed for Typescript code?

</Abstract>

## Status: :x: Replaced

Replaced with [css](/meta/records/current/styling-css) since 3 years later [CSS variables](https://caniuse.com/css-variables) are pretty much [available everywhere](/meta/records/pending/browser-support). Also [React Static](/meta/records/rejected/react-static) was replaced with [Astro](/meta/records/current/build-with-astro) which provides a great CSS modules like experience out of the box.

## Principles

- atomic approach
- abstraction and composition
- max separation of concerns, no abstract classes leaking to markup (non negotiable)
- accept "leaky abstractions" in presentation layer (but caution)

## Details

- minimal global css
- abstraction
  - utility and abstract mixins (`Shared/styles`)
  - abstract, presentation only, components (`Shared/<component>/*.mixin.scss`)
- composition:
  - [atomic hierarchy] (elements, blocks, groups, templates, layouts, behaviours)
- components first
  - minimal global css (custom properties and base)
  - component is the entry point for everything else
- tools:
  - sass variables and mixins to manage [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/?utm_campaign=Sass%2BNews&utm_medium=web&utm_source=Sass_News_9)
  - post css to opt-in for (better than pre-css because it gets out of the way)

## Why

- the future is [web components](https://www.webcomponents.org/)
- the present is [pre](http://sass.news/) + [css](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/current-work) + [post](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features)
- css custom properties - or "variables" - now widely supported (run-time!)
- css will one day have "mixins" - [@apply](https://hospodarets.com/css_apply_rule): a form of mixins, though not supporting arguments
- ... and hopefully "mixins" with arguments too

## Trade-offs

- bigger CSS files
