My first website was hosted in [tripod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripod.com), back in 1995. For the next 13 years I had a constant, tireless, and experimental presence on the web. In 2008 I took my last site down. To this day, under [andretorgal.com](http://andretorgal.com), you could only find a placeholder, a 404 or a mysterious timeout. _It's time to change this sad state of affairs._

I am working on a few thoughts about why I am coming back to my own space on the Internet.

First things first: I always had the choice to keep going.

I've been writing about this in _train of thought_ mode for a couple of days, asking a lot of whys and trying to reconstruct the narrative.

So... why I did I go for 8 years on social media without a site of my own?

Reflection yields insight, I found quite a few whys out of the writing exercise:

- because I went down the rabbit hole, got addicted to social media and lazy
- because I lost hope in the Internet of people and communities
- because I failed to keep a conversation going on my blogs
- because I lost focus and commitment
- because I got frustrated and disenchanted
- because I thought social networks would reward content creators
- because I thought more friends online would result in more sites and blogs
- because I thought everyone was going to be creating
- because sometimes I think everyone is like me :-)

Each one of these could very well be a post on its own.

Finally, how is it going to be, going forward?

## Reclaiming my web

This infinite space is still up here to take.

[Everything starts with an intent](https://medium.com/the-dogma/the-dogma-e63050ebfd7).

_Be the change you want to see in the world._

Every journey begins with the first step.

Yada, yada :-)

### Step 1

Back online under my own rules on my own domain.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">9 years without a personal website, 2 years without <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/oss?src=hash">#OSS</a> contributions :-( - this dark period ends today! <a href="https://t.co/tYl2iuRzl5">https://t.co/tYl2iuRzl5</a></p>&mdash; Andre Torgal (@andrezero) <a href="https://twitter.com/andrezero/status/840562552430034945">March 11, 2017</a></blockquote>

### Step 2

Nops, don't really have a step 2, or a plan.

I'll continue this by reading, reflecting, reaching out to friends and strangers.

Let's move on, let's stay in touch.
