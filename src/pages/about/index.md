<Abstract>

My name is André Torgal and this is my website, a place where I [blog](/posts) some thoughts and run a few experiments.

Here, you can learn more about me, [my work as software engineer](/about/work), and other stuff I have been up to.

## House rules

Just to be clear: this is my space - I own the content, the opinions are my own, and it does not represent the company I work for at the moment.

If you find something that resonates with you, or otherwise object to, feel free to drop me a line via twitter [@andrezero](https://twitter.com/andrezero) or email [info@andretorgal.com](mailto:info@andretorgal.com).

## On this website

You can find:

- some longer form [blog posts](/posts)
- as well as [a bit of everything](/feed) all at once
- or neatly organised by [tags](/tags)

## About Me

### Work

A seasoned web developer and agile practitioner with a diverse background in engineering and management. I have been coding, leading, mentoring and facilitating for 20 years. [Read more](/about/work).

### Personal

A curious and passionate person. My story includes computers, bicycles and skateboards. Guitars, drums, theater and photography. Economics, management, more computers. Software, methodologies, frameworks. [Read more](/about/story).

### Music

Bare with me while I collect my old stuff. Meanwhile, check out the latest tracks I recorded. [Read more](/about/music).

### One is a lie

- I once worked in an obscure, surreal, movie production, so my name is on [Imdb](https://imdb.com).
- I am afraid of heights, but I once bungee jumped from 68 meters high.
- Cristiano Ronaldo used to chill at my neighbor's house, but I never really talked to him.
- I got a tattoo of a French character done by an American dude in the Czech Republic.

## Under the hood

If you are curious about how this website ~~was built~~ is being built, take a look at [the docs](/meta).

_Spoiler_: it's a static site, entirely generated from Markdown files [here's the source code for the page you are currently reading](https://github.com/andrezero/andretorgal.site/blob/master/content/pages/about/index.md). I'm using [React Static](https://github.com/nozzle/react-static) as a generator, and on top of that, my models, collectors, transformers, and views, entirely written in Typescript and Scss.
