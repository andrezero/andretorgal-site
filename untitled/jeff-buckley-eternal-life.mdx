<Abstract>

For more than 20 years I have been publishing stuff on the Internet, for more than 35 playing guitar. And yet, I have never attempted uploading a video of me playing a song. So here's my first attempt at this. Let's try _Eternal Life_.

</Abstract>

I didn't choose this song because I know how to play it particularly well. I chose it because I feel it so damn real, so true.

> This is a song about... it's an angry song.
> Life's too short and too complicated for people behind desks
> and people behind masks to be ruining other people's lives

HERE!

Feels good. Not trying to play it like a cover, rather in my own style. I absolutely love Jeff's style, the open chords with the high strings in there. But I rather base it more on the power chords, thirds, the inverted D in the chorus. Also, I am not following the studio version. Instead, this is my favorite live version - [Live at Columbia Records, June 4th 1995](https://open.spotify.com/track/4OyL7DiIhq6NpglurVj9uh?si=8mi62w1iSeCeDJimERdqGA).

There is no video for that one, but here's another great rendition. All in all, despite the genius of Andy Wallace in the album version, this song sounds
so much better, and carries so much more energy, on stage.

The poster boy the recorded execs were trying to engineer - the Chris Isaak hairstyle, the romantic, sad, lonely, retro virtuoso - where is it? Gone, swallowed by a freak. Jeff Buckley live is always in cathartic mode, but especially in the more energetic songs. I wish he had made a lot more agressive music. Maybe he would still be alive.
