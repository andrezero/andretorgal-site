Some twenty years ago, me and my wife drove from Lisbon to Hendaya, taking the time to stop on average 2 times a day to enjoy at least a quick dive in a new spot. We probably drove over 3000km altogether.

For the most part of the journey through Galicia, Asturias and Cantabria, I can't really remember the names of the places we visited. Notice this was like 20 year ago. There were no hashtags to tag the photos. There was film that we could develop once back home. And there was a nice reflex camera that we eventually had stolen in Bilbao.

Also, there was no Google Maps. We had a dead tree map of the whole peninsula, not much help to determine if taking that suspicious left turn would take us to a beach, a swampy place, or a totally inaccessible cliff. It was exciting to drive down a mountain towards the sea through a snaky road, peeking around each bend to uncover a bit more of ocean blue, and to find the air smelling more and more like the "smell of the sea" (apparently the "smell of the sea" originates in [dimethyl sulfide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfide) and  pheromones produced by seaweed eggs).

For some reason, I remember most names of the places we visited in the Basque Country. Noja, Laredo, Mundaca, Zaraus, San Sebastian, San Juan de Luz. Somehow we missed this place called [Portugalete](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugalete). But we drove inland all the way to Victoria-Gasteiz, and then all the way back to the ocean.
